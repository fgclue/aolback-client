# AOLBack (Client)
AOLBack is a project with the goal of remaking AIM. The client inst the same as AIM, because AIM does not support linux. It is not a exact replica. 

If you wanna host the server, look at the repo fgclue/aolback-server.

AOLBack is not affiliated with AOL, it is just a fan project with the goal of reviving AIM.
